N.O.D.E
=======

*N.O.D.E.* is a topdown shooter but with a twist! instead of shooting your enemies
you use your kicks and your linking powers to overcome hordes of cyborgs!

*N.O.D.E.* was made in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 32 Jam competition.

## Controls ##

* Move: WASD
* Linking: Hold left mouse to target enemies, release to smash them together
* Kick: Right click
* Dash: Space
* F11/Alt+Enter: Toggle fullscreen

## Tips ##

All actions deplete stamina - use with care!

The dash can cancel certain animation locks!

Using the kick while dashing is a good way to safely approach and destroy small groups of enemies.

Don't kick grenades!

!!!CHAIN MANY ENEMIES TO GAIN HIGH COMBOS!!!
